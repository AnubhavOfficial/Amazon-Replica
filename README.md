# Amazon Clone

I am really happy to announce that I have finally completed AMAZON-CLONE project that I have been working on for the past 1 month.
I have used ReactJs and redux for the front-end part, Firebase for the user authentication and stripe for the payment handling part.
I have attached the link to the project, please have a look and let me know how is it. Also if you come accross any bugs or you wanna suggest something then I would be really happy to know that☺

P.S. : The site is not mobile responsive 🙃

Note: For payemnts please use 4242-4242-4242-4242 as the card number and any future date as the expiry date and any number as the CVV/CVC
( Because I have the payment gateway in test mode and of course who will pay real money for testing a project 😏 )
Hey guys
Hey guys I am building amazon clone using ReactJs. Its incomplete as of now.  
I am planning to use redux and sagas in this project to have a global state.  
Alongside I would love to add a user sign-in functionality. So lets hope for the best. 
  
Last but not least I would try to add payment gateway as well.


Hope to complete it soon 😎🤞
