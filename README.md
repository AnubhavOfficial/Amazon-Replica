# Amazon Clone

Live Amazon-Clone : https://amazon-clone-anubhav.netlify.app/

Hey guys this is Amazon-Clone. As the name suggests this is a replica of the real Amazon.in website.
I tried to achieve many functionalities so that you don't feel like it is actually a clone (just kidding 😆)

I have used ReactJs and redux for the front-end part, Firebase for the user authentication and stripe for the payment handling part.
I have attached the link to the project, please have a look and let me know how is it. Also if you come accross any bugs or you wanna suggest something then I would be really happy to know that 😊

+ P.S. : The site is not mobile responsive 🙃
```

### Note: For payemnts please use 4242-4242-4242-4242 as the card number and any future date as the expiry date and any number as the CVV/CVC
  ( Because I have the payment gateway in test mode and of course who will pay real money for testing a project 😏 )
