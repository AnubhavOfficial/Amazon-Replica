# Amazon Clone

Hey guys I am building amazon clone using ReactJs. Its incomplete as of now.  
I am planning to use redux and sagas in this project to have a global state.  
Alongside I would love to add a user sign-in functionality. So lets hope for the best. 
  
Last but not least I would try to add payment gateway as well.


Hope to complete it soon ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤ž
